# Operational-Transconductance-Amplifier-design
Standard OTA design in UMC 65 nm technology using LTSPICE as a part of course work at IIST.

Design Goals :

gain ≥ 70 𝑑𝐵  \\
𝑈𝐺𝐹 ≥ 100𝑀𝐻𝑧
Fully Differential OpAmp
Rail-to-Rail input capability
with CMFB stage
load capacitance 𝐶𝐿 = 500𝑓𝐹


Note :

The SCL180nm.lib library file has been used for the design which has not been uploaded here.
